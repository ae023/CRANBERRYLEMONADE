        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <p>THE BASIC INGREDIENTS OF CRANBERRY LEMONADE INCLUDE:<br>
        	•	CRANBERRY JUICE: TYPICALLY MADE FROM FRESH OR CONCENTRATED CRANBERRIES, CRANBERRY JUICE PROVIDES A TART FLAVOR AND A VIBRANT RED COLOR.<br>
        	•	LEMON JUICE: FRESHLY SQUEEZED LEMON JUICE ADDS A BRIGHT, TANGY NOTE THAT COMPLEMENTS THE CRANBERRY’S TARTNESS.<br>
        	•	SWEETENER: COMMON SWEETENERS INCLUDE SUGAR, HONEY, OR SIMPLE SYRUP, WHICH HELP TO BALANCE THE ACIDITY OF THE LEMON AND THE BITTERNESS OF THE CRANBERRY.<br>
        	•	WATER: EITHER STILL OR SPARKLING WATER IS OFTEN ADDED TO DILUTE THE MIXTURE, CREATING A REFRESHING DRINK.</p>

        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
